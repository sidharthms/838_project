Ambuj is <->the</> easily worst professor I've had and I <->think</> the dept needs to reevaluate whether <->they</> want him to teach any class again He bases his tests on what he thinks he teaches during <->lecture</> <->so</> the book <+>only</> helps minimally The <+>final</> tomorrow should be <+>interesting</> Never take a class <->with</> him I can honestly say I haven't learned anything
