<->Ambuj</> is really a <+>nice</> guy The <+>only</> thing <->is</> that the projects in <->that</> <->class</> become <+>real</> <+>bad</> <+>real</> <+>fast</> Also while he's <+>super</> <+>sweet</> he doesn't do the projects <->ahead</> of <->time</> and allows <->TAs</> not to take test <->the</> midterms therefore he doesn't understand how hard/long <->they</> are so he's not <+>very</> <+>helpful</> in office hours either
