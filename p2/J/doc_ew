<+>Overall</> I did not enjoy Jim as a lecturer With the <+>excessive</> amounts of homework lectures were <+>just</> redundant On <+>top</> of that he <->taught</> at such a <+>slow</> pace that it was <+>painful</> There were <+>only</> a few occasions where <->I</> <->felt</> <+>like</> I got something out of the lecture
