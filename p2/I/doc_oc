<+>Very</> <+>Hard</> intro teacher but was <->a</> <+>very</> <+>smart</> guy <+>Just</> not the <+>best</> teacher I felt as though I didn't really learn anything I got an A/B because I didn't <->bomb</> the tests as <+>bad</> as everyone else Curve was awesome and homework was <+>hard</> and took a lot of time Avoid teacher for math/cs240 but I'd image he's <+>good</> for the higher <+>level</> classes
