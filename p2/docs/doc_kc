I took a chance taking a <->class</> with Loris this <->semester</> as he wasn't even listed on this site Thankfully that turned out <+>pretty</> well he's <+>far</> from a <+>bad</> instructor though he can be a bit blunt at <->times</> The material is <+>very</> <+>theoretical</> at first but not too confusing once you <->begin</> applying it He's also <+>pretty</> <+>funny</> so that's a plus
