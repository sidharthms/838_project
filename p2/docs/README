The entity type we have marked up is adjectives. Since our documents
are student reviews of professors, it is relevant to know which
adjectives are used to describe the class, work, and/or professor. For
example, this data could be used for downstream sentiment analysis. We
marked them up using <+>...</> tags for positive instances
(i.e. adjectives) and <->...</> tags for negative instances.
