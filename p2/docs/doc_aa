Arun himself is a <+>pretty</> <+>funny</> and charismatic guy His section of 564 this semester is MUCH <+>better</> than the <+>other</> I <->have</> attended both The course <+>content</> really sucks but I think that Paris Koutris the <+>actual</> professor has <+>full</> control over this and Arun <+>just</> <->has</> to deal with it I do recommend him highly but not for 564 with Paris
